# SentencePiece-and-Byte-Pair-Encoding-BPE-Implementation
This repository provides a hands-on exploration of SentencePiece tokenization and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) .The code demonstrates data preprocessing steps like NFKC normalization and lossless tokenization, followed by a practical implementation of the BPE algorithm from scratch.
